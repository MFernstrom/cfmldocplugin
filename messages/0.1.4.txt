CFMLDocPlugin has been updated, I hope it will help you document your code much faster than before.

If you would like to get in touch, feel free to contact me at Marcus@MarcusFernstrom.com

To use the plugin, set up a keyboard shortcut for docifycfml in your preferences/key bindings/user

{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+2"], "command": "docifycfml" }
